# Local_Bus-Route_Finder
As we live in the city, it is also a problem to find the available transportation for our desired routes. Because one does not go to the different routes everyday so it is very common to not know the route's bus name. And today’s modern time people find it very awkward to ask which bus goes to what place. So that motivated us to build a system that makes it easier to find the names of the bus. Also, it gives us knowledge about the city. As people come outside of the city and ask us about the routes as city people it is awkward not to know the place/routes/bus names. That also inspires us to build the system. Mostly it is a problem solving system so it is helpful to people that’s also a reason.
